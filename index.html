    <h2> Q: What do I do if I'm ugly? </h2>

    <p> A: That's a good question. I still don't know yet.
      I'll let you know when I figure it out for myself. </p>

    <h2>Q: I've been skipping a class for 2 marking periods straight and now I'm worried I won't graduate.
      what should I do?</h2>

    <p> Keep skipping. I'd be surprised if the teacher still remembered your face.
      I heard they let kids out of summer school early if they're good.</p>
